## Getting Started

**Is a game for two players where you play on a greed that is 3 squares by 3 squares. To play first you have
to choose a mark, either an "x" or an "o", then you must draw this mark on a place of the grid, then then
the other player, then you again, easy right?
**To win this game one of the players has to get three of their marks in a row, either vertically, horizontally or
diagonally.**
**If all the squares of the grid are full, it is a tie.**
